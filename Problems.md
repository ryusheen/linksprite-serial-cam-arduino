Known issues:

- I tested successfully the library with HW serial (Leonardo) up to 38400 bds with no problems (no artifacts...) and with SW serial up to 19200 bds, 38400 is not really reliable. It needs much more testing though.

- chBaudRate should work.

- chPictureSize should work.

- alot others that I did not see
