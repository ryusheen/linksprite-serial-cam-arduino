Library to control the small serial ttl cam by linksprite.
It is for arduino-1.0 and up.

There are 2 example sketches to take and capture the picture: one using an HW serial port and the other using SW serial port. The library does not care, just make sure to be at max 19200 bds for the SW serial port, at least that was the max speed where the results were reliable for me.
